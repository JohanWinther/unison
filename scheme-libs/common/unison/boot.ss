; This library implements various syntactic constructs and functions
; that are used in the compilation of unison (intermediate) source to
; scheme. The intent is to provide for writing scheme definitions that
; more directly match the source, so that the compiler doesn't need to
; emit all the code necessary to fix up the difference itself.
;
; Probably the best example of this is the define-unison macro, which
; looks similar to scheme's define, but the function being defined is
; allowed to be under/over applied similar to a unison function. It
; has an 'arity' at which computation happens, but the function
; automatically handles being applied to fewer or more arguments than
; that arity appropriately.

  ; Wrapper that more closely matches `handle` constructs
  ;
  ; Note: this uses the prompt _twice_ to achieve the sort of dynamic
  ; scoping we want. First we push an outer delimiter, then install
  ; the continuation marks corresponding to the handled abilities
  ; (which tells which propt to use for that ability and which
  ; functions to use for each request). Then we re-delimit by the same
  ; prompt.
  ;
  ; If we just used one delimiter, we'd have a problem. If we pushed
  ; the marks _after_ the delimiter, then the continuation captured
  ; when handling would contain those marks, and would effectively
  ; retain the handler for requests within the continuation. If the
  ; marks were outside the prompt, we'd be in a similar situation,
  ; except where the handler would be automatically handling requests
  ; within its own implementation (although, in both these cases we'd
  ; get control errors, because we would be using the _function_ part
  ; of the handler without the necessary delimiters existing on the
  ; continuation). Both of these situations are wrong for _shallow_
  ; handlers.
  ;
  ; Instead, what we need to be able to do is capture the continuation
  ; _up to_ the marks, then _discard_ the marks, and this is what the
  ; multiple delimiters accomplish. There might be more efficient ways
  ; to accomplish this with some specialized mark functions, but I'm
  ; uncertain of what pitfalls there are with regard to that (whehter
  ; they work might depend on exact frame structure of the
  ; metacontinuation).
